# Business-Forecasting---ECON453
Term Project on Time Series Analysis on CO2 Dataset 

The project is about choosing the best forecast model for the given dataset. The dataset 
is a monthly time series data between the years 1959 and 1998 about the Mauna Loa 
Atmospheric CO2 Concentration. Three main models are considered and analyzed. The last 24 
observations are used for the test set while the other observations are considered as the training 
set to train the model. The analysis is made by using R with the packages of “baseR” and 
“astsa”.

Model1: Linear Model
Model2: Model with STL
Model3: ARIMA Model
